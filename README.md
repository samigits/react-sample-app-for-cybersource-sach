# Getting Started with Create React App

## About The App

I built this sample react app to make developers understand the fields and steps to follow when you integrate cybersource payment gateway. Keep in mind that it uses cybersource secure acceptace hosted checkout and It is only the frontend part. To make this app fully functional, don't forget to clone a nodeJs backend repositry [here](https://github.com/samigits/secure-acceptance-hosed-checkout-backend-nodejs).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
